# opencv-ASL-translator
This awesome DeltaHacks VIII project was inspired to assist anyone trying to learn or understand ASL (American Sign Language)

Using Computer Vision and AI we transformed real-time visual input into english words for those who do not know sign language.

Bringing the change to understanding and learning this year, we hope to make a delta by assisting those who struggle with communication and those who are inspired to learn to help make that difference.
